## The following is implemented:
1. Create a Pizza Ordering App Using the Builder Pattern
Description: Create a pizza ordering app that allows users to customize their orders. Apply the Builder pattern to simplify the process of creating a pizza with different ingredients. Consider how you can organize the interface for selecting options and how this will affect the final order.

2. Design a small game in which the player can select characters with different abilities and a location using the Factory pattern. Create a method that will generate descriptions of the situation depending on the selected character and location.
For example, if the user selects:
Character: Mage
Terrain: Desert
then we will see:
"A mage with a long robe and a magic wand is in a hot desert with sand dunes and rare plants."

Requirements:
Characters: The player should be able to choose from different character classes (e.g. mage, warrior, shooter), each with unique abilities.
Environment: The game should include different types of terrain (e.g. forest, desert, city).
